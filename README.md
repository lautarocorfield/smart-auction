# Partial Refund Auction

A Solidity smart contract implementing a decentralized auction system with key features:

- Bidding system with minimum price enforcement.
- Each new bid must exceed the previous one by at least **5%**.
- Anti-sniping: late bids extend the auction time by 10 minutes.
- Partial refund system for bidders who placed multiple offers.
- 2% commission on refunded bids (retained by the contract owner).
- Only the owner can finalize the auction once the time is up.
- Emergency ETH withdrawal function for the owner.

📌 Notes
* All ETH sent directly to the contract is rejected — bids must go through bid().

* The auction is extended by 10 minutes if a bid comes in the last 10 minutes.

* Only the owner can finalize the auction.

* Losing bidders receive 98% of their bid as refund; 2% is retained as commission.

* Partial refunds are only allowed for users with more than one offer.
